<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Jeffrey Bekker</h1>
<hr>
<h4>I'm an aspiring Python Django Developer. I love building clean, scalable and responsive web apps.</h4>
<hr>
🔭 I’m currently working on a more advanced project where I build APIs and implement plenty of useful functionalities.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate with company where I can use my skills and can learn more about Back-End Development, and perhaps Front-End!
🌱 I’m currently learning APIs on a deeper level. After that, I'll be focussing on using MySQL. 
👨‍💻 Furthermore, I'd like to learn Postman (currently I'm using Insomnia), HTML, CSS and Javascript.
